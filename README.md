## About

This portfolio serves as a digital representation of my journey as a software engineer. It features a variety of projects I’ve built, spanning web development, full-stack applications, and more. Each project includes a detailed breakdown of the technologies used, the challenges I faced, and the solutions I implemented.

Inspired by actual tech companies' websites, the project was completed using only React, JavaScript, vanilla CSS, and HTML (except for some icons that were pulled from Bootstrap).

Feedback is welcome and appreciated!!
